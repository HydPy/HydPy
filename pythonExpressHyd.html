            <h4>PythonExpress Hyderabad.</h4>
            <p>
                As part of <a href="http://www.hydpy.org">Hyderabad Python User's group activities</a>, we organizse workshops and sessions in colleges for free or minimal cost. This is part of the India wide PythonExpress initiative where any college can request for a workshop and experts can accept a workshop &amp; can deliver the workshop in the college. 
                <br/>
                We as HydPy make colleges in Hyderabad aware of the initiative, work with student ambassdors to schedule &amp; conduct the workshops and get more experts on the platform.
                <br/>
                <br/>
                <h5>Campus Ambassador Programme</h5>
                To accomplish this we have started a campus ambassador programme where student developer community leaders work for learning &amp; spreading python &amp; open source in their respective colleges. The HydPy community will support students with Open source Projects, and conducting workshops etc. to grow the student communities in Colleges in Hyderabad. This programme allows us to provide a platform to have college activities like open source projects, python workshops &amp; open source student activities centralized across the city. Excited?
